    <h1 id="osteoarthritis-a-beginners-guide-to-chronic-joint-pain-and-inflammation">Osteoarthritis. A beginner’s guide to chronic joint pain and inflammation</h1>
<p>You know those aching joints that develop over time. It begins as a mild discomfort and your joints seem creaky somewhere down the line. Before you know it, over a few months or even years, the discomfort develops into full blown joint pain that makes movements miserable. You don’t know what it is, but you try to fix it with teas, lotions recommended by a neighbour or a suggestion by a friend to resolve it with warm baths. What you don’t know is, depending on your age and your physical condition, it could be Osteoarthritis. It is a serious medical condition that requires expert medical help to manage.</p>
<h2 id="the-facts-about-osteoarthritis">The facts about Osteoarthritis</h2>
<p>Osteoarthritis involves chronic inflammation of one or more joints of the body. It is the most common type of arthritis and it is directly connected to wear and tear on the joints. Research suggests that Osteoarthritis is one of the most common causes of joint pain and is responsible for the most common Visit factors to ortho clinics and hospitals in the last few decades after low back ache and neck pain.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-risk-factors-for-osteoarthritis">What are the risk factors for Osteoarthritis</h2>
<p>There are many risk factors for Osteoarthritis. While age is one of the most crucial factors, Osteoarthritis can affect anyone regardless of age. The most common cause of Osteoarthritis is overuse of joints. This can be due to many factors including stress use of joints in the form of work, wear and tear based on overuse/ usage of joints in abnormal positions, obesity and its effects like stress and strain on the joints etc. Age is a typical factor when you consider all the data and statistics involving Osteoarthritis. It is a commonly known fact that adults over the age of 60 typically have symptoms of Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-the-common-causes-of-arthritis">Some of the common causes of arthritis</h2>
<h3 id="bad-posture">Bad Posture</h3>
<p>This is often the most common cause of Osteoarthritis. A bad posture not only harms your spine, but it also harms your joints right from the neck, to shoulders, to your hip joints and your leg joints in more ways than one. It is important to learn the right postures to sit, sleep, walk or run in order to restrict your chances of acquiring Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 id="old-age">Old Age</h3>
<p>Osteoarthritis seems to occur frequently in old age. The reason for this could be multifold. The bones and cartilage go through a series of changes as you grow older. Most of these changes make both the bones and the cartilage more porous. As the cartilage grows more porous, it tends to give way sooner than bones and the result is a combination of factors that forms Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 id="prior-injury">Prior Injury</h3>
<p>Injury is often a common cause of Osteoarthritis in younger patients. Bone injuries and joint injuries have a tendency to proliferate as you grow older. Injuries sustained in younger ages cannot be ignored as they can grow to become a problem with your bones and joints as you grow older. These injuries need to be treated as soon as you can find them as they’re essential to prevent Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-activity">Lack of Activity</h3>
<p>Sedentary lifestyles also contribute in Osteoarthritis cases. Being sedentary robs your body of the means to keep active, and keep the joints moving. The absence of movement means the joints become idle, and much like an old car, joints that don’t move begin to lock up and stop responding. You might often feel pain in the knees and joints if you walk after a long break from physical activity. That is your body telling you that it’s time you took up a sport.</p>
<h3 id="extreme-stress">Extreme Stress</h3>
<p>Stress is a huge factor in determining how healthy your body is. When it comes to health, stress can determine a whole lot more than any kind of medicine can. Stress is anathema to the body’s ability to defend itself from a wide variety of diseases including bone and joint issues. Stress contributes to exaggerated perceptions of pain. These aren’t just symptoms, they’re signals to your body that it’s beginning to overly react against a normal composition. And, it will unless you work against it.</p>
<h3 id="weather-changes">Weather Changes</h3>
<p>Changes in weather can most often be quoted when it comes to older patients. However, it’s not only restricted to them. Weather changes can affect most sufferers of joint pain and it’s very important to know when weather changes affect you so you can tell your doctor how it affects you. Joints are prone to be affected by even minor changes in temperature and its essential that you keep note of how weather changes affect how you feel pain in the joints.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-your-bones-and-joints-safe-is-your-best-bet-in-the-long-term">Keeping your bones and joints safe is your best bet in the long term</h2>
<p>When it comes to joint pain and Osteoarthritis, prevention is better than the cure. While it is essential that you exercise and keep yourself active in the long term, Osteoarthritis can affect you in many ways other than a sedentary lifestyle and old age. It is important to keep yourself educated on the many ways that Osteoarthritis can hit your life and ensure you stay safe and cautious when it comes to prevention, symptoms and solutions.</p>
