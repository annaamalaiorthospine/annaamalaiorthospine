                            <p>Inflammation and degeneration in the joints leads to pain and this condition is called <strong>Arthritis</strong>. Pain can be managed to a certain extent with medication and physiotherapy in the initial stages. Arthritis is the kind of condition that gets worse with time.</p>
<p><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> and <strong>Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong> are the most common types of this chronic arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a result of the wear and tear of the cartilages in the joints causing <strong>joint pain</strong>. But Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic auto-immune condition that causes pain at various parts of the body especially involving the small joints. Joint replacement surgery is not the first course of action, but the final one. At the outset, Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj suggests other non-surgical methods to control arthritis pain – such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using hot and cold packs for pain relief</li>
<li>Taking a course of pain medication</li>
<li>Therapist assisted physiotherapy</li>
<li>Steroid and oil injections in the joints to reduce swelling, pain and to increase the joint lubrication.</li>
<li>Stem cell therapy/ PRP therapy (platelet-rich plasma) to slow down the disease&rsquo;s progress and to have some regeneration.</li>
<li>Weight management</li>

<h2 id="causes-for-back--neck-pain-include">Causes for Back &amp; Neck pain include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strenuous activity</li>

<li>An Infection or a tumorous growth</li>
</ul>
<p>The prescribed treatment varies depending on whether it&rsquo;s acute or chronic, and also on the exact region of the pain. Acute pain usually goes away in a few days and can be treated/ managed with pain medication. Chronic pain however, needs to be treated in several ways to help the individual carry on with a normal life in spite of the persistent pain. Surgery is the last option.</p>
<h2 id="back-and-neck-pain-treatment-options-include">Back and Neck Pain Treatment options include:</h2>
<ul>

<p>What causes chronic pain? In some cases it could be due to another condition such as arthritis or cancer. In some cases doctors find it hard to pin-point the cause. Often chronic pain begins due to a certain injury or disease, and even after recovering from that injury or disease, the pain stays on.</p>
<h2 id="treating-or-managing-chronic-pain-depends-on-a-few-key-factors">Treating or managing chronic pain depends on a few key factors:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where does the pain develop?</li>
<li>When did it start?</li>
<li>How intense is it?</li>
<li>How often does it occur?</li>
<li>Any specific triggers that worsen the pain?</li>
<li>Details regarding past illness or surgeries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj</strong> understands the nature of chronice and that there is no single guaranteed technique to treat chronic pain. <strong>Chronic Pain management</strong> includes a combination of options in the right measure that can provide relief.</p>
<h2 id="some-chronic-pain-treatment-options-include">Some Chronic Pain treatment options include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Drug therapy/ medication for chronic pain</li>
<li>Physical therapy by employing stretching strengthening, and pain-relieving techniques</li>
<li>Exercise- it is easier for certain chronic pain sufferers than others such as swimming, cycling.</li>
<li>TENS or Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Therapy</li>
<li>Psychological Treatment</li>
<li>Surgical procedures such as intrathecal pump and spinal cord stimulator implantation.</li>

                            <p>A fracture refers to a broken bone and this could even be a small crack. The initial management of a fracture involves two important steps: realignment of the broken limb and then immobilizing it with the help of a splint. Splinting provides symptomatic pain relief and prevents further injury to the local soft tissues.</p>
<p>Fractures are of 2 types, In the case of a <strong>closed fracture</strong> their skin remains intact and in an <strong>open fracture</strong> the ends of the broken bone tear your skin. When your bone and other internal tissues are exposed, it puts you at higher risk of infection.</p>
<p>At Annamalai Ortho and Spine Center, initial fracture management focuses on controlling hemorrhage, providing pain relief and ensuring the injured part is protected from infection. Then we work towards reducing the fracture and maintaining it that way so that the fractured bone will heal in such a way that it will retain maximum functionality. This means the fracture reduction technique is employed along with immobilization of the fracture limb using a cast or a splint. An undisplaced fracture will heal by casting and immobilization, while a displaced fracture requires surgical treatments, for fracture healing and union. Fixation of fracture with metal screws, pins, rods or plates to hold the bones in place is known as open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Once the fracture has healed, physiotherapy is necessary to restore mobility.</p>

                            <p><strong>Platelet rich plasma</strong> therapy is commonly referred to as &lsquo;PRP&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Annamalai Ortho and Spine Center offers <strong>PRP Therapy</strong>, an advanced non-operative out-patient procedure that can provide a permanent solution for conditions such as arthritis and ligament/tendon sprains and tears.</p>
<p>30ml of blood is taken from the patient&rsquo;s own body and centrifuged using a special machine to separate the platelets and growth factors from the red and white cells. These platelets have growth factors that can kick start our normal healing process and so they are injected into the damaged ligaments, tendons, and joints to promote tissue repair and accelerate healing. <strong>PRP therapy</strong> produces better tissue healing in tendon injuries and in cartilage defects. On average, an injured individual can get back to a pain-free life in four to six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>PRP treatment</strong> is a safe option with no risk of allergic reaction because it is your own blood. However, it is not the first line of treatment. We will explore other conservative treatment options and only when they do not produce satisfying results, PRP therapy is suggested. PRP has proven to be effective in treating osteoarthritis by stimulating healing of cartilage and reducing pain. This includes <a href="./arthritis-management">osteoarthritis</a> of knee, hip, shoulder and ankle</p>

<p>Joint replacement can definitely help to improve overall quality of life by allowing patients to do daily activities free of pain. Depending on the joint that is giving trouble and the extent of damage, your doctor will decide the type of joint replacement surgery required. <a href="./arthritis-management"><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></a> is most often the cause for joint pain that eventually calls for joint replacement surgery. This condition is prevalent with the geriatric population.</p>
<p>Joint replacement surgery involves removal of the worn cartilage with damaged bone and resurfacing it with a metalic artificial joint. The Replacement implant looks and functions much like a normal joint. <strong>Hip Replacement Surgery</strong> and <strong>Knee Replacement Surgery</strong> are the most common types of joint replacement performed. A hip or <strong>knee replacement</strong> is expected to last for 20 or more years making it a lifelong solution or <strong>cure for <a href="./arthritis-management">arthritis</a></strong> of the hip or knee.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Osteoporosis&rsquo; quite literally means &lsquo;porous bone&rsquo; and the disease itself weakens bones causing less bone mass and strength. This means that someone with the condition is at greater risk for sudden and unexpected bone <a href="./fracture-management"><strong>fracture</strong></a>. Most of these are fractures of the hip, wrist and spine. Unfortunately the disease creeps up on one silently with no visible symptoms or pain. It is usually discovered only when the weakened bone fractures.</p>
<p>Bones protect internal organs and provide overall support to the body. But they play a vital role in storing calcium and other minerals. When the body needs calcium, it breaks down and rebuilds bone. Up until 30-35 years of age an individual builds more bone than he/she loses. After 35, bone breakdown occurs faster than bone buildup. Over a period of time there is a loss of bone mass. In older females, bone mass loss happens at a faster rate post menopause. Even simple household tasks can result in Osteoporotic compression fractures in these set of people.</p>

                            <p>The spine is made up of several cylindrical bones called vertebrae and between each vertebra is a disc. These discs are made of a rubbery/jelly material that gives the spine its flexibility. The soft jelly-like centre of the disc, may sometimes leak out due to a weakness in the outer part of the disc. This is what is referred to as a herniated disc or prolapsed disc or protruded disc.</p>
<p>Though it is commonly called &lsquo;slipped disc&rsquo;, the disc does not move but is in fact pressing against a nerve root which can cause lower back pain and leg pain (sciatica). One can have a herniated disc anywhere along our spine, even in our neck, but it’s most likely to occur in the lower back (lumbar vertebrae). If a herniated disc occurs in the neck, there might be pain in the neck, shoulders, and arms. Besides pain, other herniated disc symptoms are numbness, tingling, and weakness.</p>
<p>A Herniated disc is usually very painful and most people feel much better with nonsurgical treatment in the form of rest, exercise and physiotherapy.Initial line of treatment includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete Rest</li>
<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication to manage pain and reduce swelling</li>
<li>Exercises or physical therapy to improve functionality</li>
<li>Selective nerve root block injection to reduce pain signals sent to the brain.</li>
</ol>
<p>If these modalities don&rsquo;t help and if the patients have persistent pain that interferes with the quality of life, then Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj suggests surgical intervention. Discectomy is the most common surgery recommended for herniated discs in the lumbar region. The procedure involves removal of the part of the disc that is causing the pressure on the nerve root. Nowadays the surgery involves a smaller incision and special instruments to achieve the same results. This is called Microdiscectomy/ key hole discectomy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Sciatica</strong> is a collective term for a combination of symptoms such as <strong>leg pain</strong>, tingling or numbness that travels down the low back via the sciatic nerve in the back of the leg. Sciatica can be caused by disc herniation compressing the spine nerve, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and spondylolisthesis.</p>
<p>In order to prevent further damage and to curb the progress of the underlying issue causing sciatica, immediate treatment is essential.</p>
<p>Dr. Vignesh Pusparaj approaches the treatment based on the individual&rsquo;s specific symptoms/ needs. The first line of <strong>sciatica treatment</strong> is most often non-invasive. It typically includes a combination of physical therapy, pain medications, therapeutic injections for pain relief, and alternative therapies. Physical therapy for sciatica aims at strengthening the spine and <strong>lower back muscles</strong>, abdomen, buttocks, and hip and increasing core strength. Stretching tight muscles, such as hamstrings to improves mobility. Light aerobic exercises such as walking, swimming, or pool therapy promotes overall good health and fitness. Too much bed rest can be detrimental to the treatment. Injections are administered in order to reduce inflammation at the nerve root level, this helps reduce <strong>sciatica pain</strong>. The Selective Nerve Root Block injection is administered at the spinal nerve to reduces inflammation and numb the pain signal transmitted by the pinched nerve.</p>
<p>Surgical intervention for Sciatica is prescribed only when the pain does not reduce through these non-invasive methods of treatment and the individual is finding it harder to perform regular everyday activities.</p>

                            <p>If you fear that there is some structural problem with your spine, then an appointment with Dr. Vignesh Pushparaj is in order. Kyphosis and Scoliosis affect the structure of the spine. Scoliosis refers to an S-shaped or C-shaped spinal deformity that is noticeable when looking directly at the person.</p>
<p>Whereas Kyphosis is an increased forward spinal angulation that is noticeable while looking at someone from the side. In their mild forms, both conditions do not interfere with the normal functioning of the individual. However, if it causes pain and difficulty in walking or standing, then it calls for a visit to the doctor. Scoliosis occurs mostly in children, which worsens with age and maturity. Timely intervention is the key to treating pediatric scoliosis.</p>
<p>The most common cause of Adult scoliosis is degenerative spinal arthritis, which can cause slight instability and eccentric loading of the spine, causing it to curve. The most common cause of adult kyphosis is osteoporosis compression fractures, degenerative spondylosis (arthritis of the spine) or due to post-surgical changes. Pain, difficulty walking, difficulty in standing and a sense of feeling &lsquo;off balance&rsquo; are the most common symptoms of patients with either of these conditions.</p>
<p>Initial treatment options are conservative modes: Physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and pain relief medication. Epidural steroid injections and/or nerve root blocks are options for those with severe pain or for those who are not seeing results with conservative treatment. When these non-invasive treatment techniques fail, surgical intervention might be necessary. The surgical treatment of adult scoliosis and/or kyphosis is spinal fusion or mending the spine bones together using metal rods and screws.</p>

                            <p>We at Annamalai Spine and Ortho Center understand how debilitating a spine fracture can be. Unlike a fracture in any other bone, a fracture in the spine can really put you out of action. From experiencing a nagging pain to not being able to stand or walk around t or even be paralyzed, the impact of a spinal injury or fracture can be quite dire.</p>
<p>A spine fracture and dislocation can pinch, compress and even tear the spinal cord, causing terrible pain and paralysis of the parts below the level of injury. Treatment of spinal fractures depends on the type of fracture and the extent of the injury.</p>
<h2 id="spine-fracture-types">Spine Fracture Types:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The most common type is spine compression fracture where excessive downward force shatters and collapses the body of the vertebrae.</li>
<li>When the discs connecting two vertebrae together get overly stretched or are torn, the bones may come out of alignment leading to a vertebral dislocation that can cause spinal instability.</li>
<li>Fracture-dislocations happen when the bone is broken and the ligaments/discs are torn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of spine injury and spine fracture is a medical/ surgical emergency. Spine fractures with paralysis need treatment within the first 24 hours of injury. Thus we can try and restore the normal function back.</strong></p>
<h2 id="spine-fracture-treatment-options">Spine Fracture Treatment options:</h2>
<p>Treatment depends on the type of fracture, degree of spinal instability and its associated spinal cord injury.</p>
<ol>
<li>Surgery to stabilize the spine and to relieve the spinal cord/nerves from compression.</li>
<li>Minimally invasive spine fracture stabilisation</li>
<li>Fracture stabilisation with anterior bone reconstruction.</li>

<p>Physiotherapy treatment finds use in both prevention and rehabilitation. It can also be part of the treatment for problems caused by injury, disease or disability. Physiotherapy has proven beneficial in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neck pain and back pain</li>
<li>Arthritis related problems in the bones, joints, muscles and ligaments</li>
<li>After-effects of amputation</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>Loss of mobility because of trauma to the brain or spine</li>
<li>Fatigue, pain, swelling, stiffness and loss of muscle strength as side effects from treatments for diseases such as cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>An X-ray is an imaging technique used to get a closer look at problems causing bones and joints. Bone related problems that may be detected during an X-ray include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bone fractures and breaks</li>
<li>Joint orthritis</li>
<li>scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine)</li>
<li>Abnormal bony growth (Cancer/ Carcinoma)</li>

<p>You know those aching joints that develop over time. It begins as a mild discomfort and your joints seem creaky somewhere down the line. Before you know it, over a few months or even years, the discomfort develops into full blown joint pain that makes movements miserable. You don’t know what it is, but you try to fix it with teas, lotions recommended by a neighbour or a suggestion by a friend to resolve it with warm baths. What you don’t know is, depending on your age and your physical condition, it could be Osteoarthritis. It is a serious medical condition that requires expert medical help to manage.</p>
<h2 id="the-facts-about-osteoarthritis">The facts about Osteoarthritis</h2>
<p>Osteoarthritis involves chronic inflammation of one or more joints of the body. It is the most common type of arthritis and it is directly connected to wear and tear on the joints. Research suggests that Osteoarthritis is one of the most common causes of joint pain and is responsible for the most common Visit factors to ortho clinics and hospitals in the last few decades after low back ache and neck pain.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-risk-factors-for-osteoarthritis">What are the risk factors for Osteoarthritis</h2>
<p>There are many risk factors for Osteoarthritis. While age is one of the most crucial factors, Osteoarthritis can affect anyone regardless of age. The most common cause of Osteoarthritis is overuse of joints. This can be due to many factors including stress use of joints in the form of work, wear and tear based on overuse/ usage of joints in abnormal positions, obesity and its effects like stress and strain on the joints etc. Age is a typical factor when you consider all the data and statistics involving Osteoarthritis. It is a commonly known fact that adults over the age of 60 typically have symptoms of Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-the-common-causes-of-arthritis">Some of the common causes of arthritis</h2>
<h3 id="bad-posture">Bad Posture</h3>
<p>This is often the most common cause of Osteoarthritis. A bad posture not only harms your spine, but it also harms your joints right from the neck, to shoulders, to your hip joints and your leg joints in more ways than one. It is important to learn the right postures to sit, sleep, walk or run in order to restrict your chances of acquiring Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 id="old-age">Old Age</h3>
<p>Osteoarthritis seems to occur frequently in old age. The reason for this could be multifold. The bones and cartilage go through a series of changes as you grow older. Most of these changes make both the bones and the cartilage more porous. As the cartilage grows more porous, it tends to give way sooner than bones and the result is a combination of factors that forms Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 id="prior-injury">Prior Injury</h3>
<p>Injury is often a common cause of Osteoarthritis in younger patients. Bone injuries and joint injuries have a tendency to proliferate as you grow older. Injuries sustained in younger ages cannot be ignored as they can grow to become a problem with your bones and joints as you grow older. These injuries need to be treated as soon as you can find them as they’re essential to prevent Osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-activity">Lack of Activity</h3>
<p>Sedentary lifestyles also contribute in Osteoarthritis cases. Being sedentary robs your body of the means to keep active, and keep the joints moving. The absence of movement means the joints become idle, and much like an old car, joints that don’t move begin to lock up and stop responding. You might often feel pain in the knees and joints if you walk after a long break from physical activity. That is your body telling you that it’s time you took up a sport.</p>
<h3 id="extreme-stress">Extreme Stress</h3>
<p>Stress is a huge factor in determining how healthy your body is. When it comes to health, stress can determine a whole lot more than any kind of medicine can. Stress is anathema to the body’s ability to defend itself from a wide variety of diseases including bone and joint issues. Stress contributes to exaggerated perceptions of pain. These aren’t just symptoms, they’re signals to your body that it’s beginning to overly react against a normal composition. And, it will unless you work against it.</p>
<h3 id="weather-changes">Weather Changes</h3>
<p>Changes in weather can most often be quoted when it comes to older patients. However, it’s not only restricted to them. Weather changes can affect most sufferers of joint pain and it’s very important to know when weather changes affect you so you can tell your doctor how it affects you. Joints are prone to be affected by even minor changes in temperature and its essential that you keep note of how weather changes affect how you feel pain in the joints.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-your-bones-and-joints-safe-is-your-best-bet-in-the-long-term">Keeping your bones and joints safe is your best bet in the long term</h2>
<p>When it comes to joint pain and Osteoarthritis, prevention is better than the cure. While it is essential that you exercise and keep yourself active in the long term, Osteoarthritis can affect you in many ways other than a sedentary lifestyle and old age. It is important to keep yourself educated on the many ways that Osteoarthritis can hit your life and ensure you stay safe and cautious when it comes to prevention, symptoms and solutions.</p>
